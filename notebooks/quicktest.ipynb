OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently stated that ChatGPT is already more powerful than any human, and revealed that Meta offered OpenAI staff $100 million signing bonuses to poach talent. Amazon's CEO has indicated that AI could lead to a smaller corporate workforce. AMD unveiled its latest chips with OpenAI among its customers, while Uber has expanded its AI solutions business by setting up a new foundry.\\n\\nLegal battles are intensifying as Anthropic won a ruling that AI training on copyrighted books doesn't break the law, though they must still face trial on pirated books. Meta has launched a lawsuit against a 'nudify' AI company over Facebook and Instagram ads. North Korea's BlueNoroff group is using AI deepfakes to push Mac malware through fake Zoom calls, representing a new cybersecurity threat.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has moved to deregulate AI and autonomous vehicles, prioritizing the removal of restrictions on artificial intelligence that powers driver-assistance functions and robotaxis. In the financial sector, banking is being reimagined in the age of AI, with new research suggesting that AI exposure has not caused widespread harm to workers' mental health and may even improve physical health among less educated employees.\\n\\n**UK AI News:**\\n\\nInnovate UK has partnered with PwC to launch an AI skills hub, while job growth in industries exposed to AI has seen a rapid drop. The UK government is pursuing an £18 billion IT services tender as part of a massive drive to adopt AI across the public sector. A new University of Birmingham-led research hub called Co-AIMS aims to revolutionize UK manufacturing through AI to help achieve Net Zero by 2050.\\n\\nThe BBC has threatened legal action against AI startup Perplexity over content scraping, marking the corporation's first move to protect its content from being used without permission to build AI technology. Perplexity has rejected the BBC's legal claims over AI-driven news content reuse.
